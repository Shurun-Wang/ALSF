# Auto-learning search framework based on a weighted double Q-learning algorithm
![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=https://github.com/Shurun-Wang/ALSF&label=visitors&countColor=%232ccce4&style=plastic)  This is the official source code repository of "Integrated block-wise neural network with auto-learning search framework for finger gesture recognition using sEMG signals".

We provide the core code for you to better understand the neural architecture search method proposed in our paper. The first step is to download the dataset in [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/QTDatabase/24511864) and put them in 'data' file. The dataset contains the preprocessed sEMG images of all subjects. We used two GPU to accelerate the NAS process, maybe you need to modify a few lines of code.
